# Dictionary-Application-using-Red-Black-Trees
 Most of the Binary Search Tree operation (e.g., search, max, min, insert) take O(h) time where h is the height of the Binary Search Tree.
 
The cost of these operation can become O(n) if the tree is skewed.

That's why people invented Red Black Tree which is a balanced Tree structure which always maintain its height to make sure that each operation only cost O(log n) worstly where n is the number of
nodes.

 The program is an application based on Red Black Tree Implementation made in DataStructure.py file.
 
**The program supports the following operations:** 
 1. Load Dictionary from file into a Red Black Tree
 2. Print Dictionary Size which prints the number of node
 3. Insert Word which make you insert whatever you wants
 4. Look-up a Word if it exists in the dictionary or not
 5. Print Height of the Tree
